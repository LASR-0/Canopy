# Canopy — State & Roadmap

Open-source desktop app for managing indoor grow setups using **local** smart
devices (sensors, lighting, agricultural actuators). It discovers devices on the
LAN itself, visualises their data, and runs scheduled + reactive automations per
grow cycle and grow mode.

This document supersedes `HANDOFF.md`. It is the canonical record of decisions
and the current plan. **Read it before changing anything.** The project is
already scaffolded — never run a scaffolder or re-init; add dependencies with
`pnpm add` inside the right package.

Last verified against the code: **2026-09-26**.

## Primary platform: Linux

**Development happens on Linux from here on.** Windows and macOS remain release
targets, but Linux is where the work gets done.

The reason is practical: the project started on a Windows home PC, but that
machine now runs **Omarchy** (Arch + Hyprland/Wayland). The only remaining
Windows box is the work machine, which has **WSL2 (Ubuntu)**. Linux is therefore
the one environment available in both places — native at home, WSL2 at work.
Developing the Windows build would mean working two days a week.

This is a change of development host, not of architecture. Nothing on the
critical path is OS-specific: telemetry ingestion, the rules engine, the
scheduler and the remaining pages are all pure TypeScript. The genuinely
OS-divergent work — service registration and packaging — comes last and is
tracked as Phase 8.

**Windows is not abandoned.** It builds and runs today (verified), and the
Wi-Fi provisioning path already has a Windows implementation. Keep it green in
CI; don't regress it.

---

## Current state (verified, not aspirational)

`HANDOFF.md` had drifted badly out of date — it described the backend as
"skeleton stubs only", the HTTP library as undecided, and the Electron install
as blocked. All three were wrong. What follows was checked against the code.

### Working

- **Windows runtime is unblocked.** `electron.exe` and `better_sqlite3.node` are
  built; the backend boots and `GET /health` responds. The pnpm
  `approve-builds` issue is resolved (approvals live in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
  under `allowBuilds`, not `package.json`).
- **Linux runtime is unblocked.** `pnpm dev` launches the Electron window under
  Hyprland/Wayland on Omarchy. See "Electron on Linux" below for the two faults
  that had to be cleared.
- **Fastify** is the chosen HTTP/WS library and is fully wired
  (`api/server.ts`, 14 route modules registered).
- **Primer token set is ported** — `styles/index.css` is ~1,300 lines.
- **Overview** (`pages/Overview.tsx`) and **Settings** (`pages/Settings.tsx`)
  are complete and wired to real endpoints, with **no mock data** — and since
  Phase 3 they show live values rather than empty cards.
- **SQLite + Drizzle store** — 19 tables, DDL applied at startup.
- **Device discovery** — embedded Aedes broker, mDNS scanner, HA-style retained
  config discovery, Shelly announce, heartbeat monitor, scan sessions.
- **Device simulator** — a full tent's worth of HA-discoverable MQTT devices
  over loopback. See Phase 2.
- **Telemetry ingestion** — sensor readings reach `readings_raw` and the
  websocket. See Phase 3.
- **Actuation** — devices can be driven over MQTT, and the controller has a
  real pause/resume/stop lifecycle. See Phase 4.
- **Scheduler** — photoperiod windows and cron automations drive real hardware;
  reading rollups and retention pruning run as tracked jobs. See Phase 5.
- **Rules engine** — readings drive condition → action automations, with
  threshold alerts and device up/down recorded to the timeline. See Phase 6.
- **Tests** — 214 passing across 12 files.

### Recently fixed (Phase 0)

- `pnpm typecheck` now passes across all three packages. It had been failing in
  `provision.ts`, and that failure was *masking* three further errors in the
  frontend (Web Bluetooth types, and a `null` assigned to an optional-not-
  nullable `activeWorkspaceId` under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`).
- `provision.ts` had no Linux branch — it dispatched `darwin → airport` and
  *everything else* → `netsh`, so Wi-Fi scanning silently returned nothing on
  Linux. Added an `nmcli` scanner.
- A second controller instance now exits with a clear message instead of an
  `EADDRINUSE` stack trace.
- Build artifacts untracked, `.gitattributes` added — see "Two-machine
  workflow".

### The data pipe — now connected inbound, still open outbound

This was the headline: a finished UI over a pipe that never delivered. The
inbound half is closed as of Phase 3. Readings flow, so the Overview shows real
numbers. What remains:

- **No actuator state.** Commands go out and devices echo their new state on
  the state topic, but ingestion treats that as proof of life only. Nothing
  stores or reports whether a fan is actually running, so a rule can fire and
  the UI still cannot show the result.
- **No archive database.** Completed grows are never moved out of the live DB,
  so it grows without bound. The `archive_grow` job type exists and has no
  handler. See "Retention".
- **No derived metrics.** The schema reserves `device_id = "__derived__"` for
  VPD and DLI and nothing computes them, so the Overview never shows a VPD card.
  VPD is a pure function of temperature and humidity, both of which now flow, so
  this is small and worth doing early.

### Stubbed routes

Return fabricated or empty data, not persisted: `journal`.

`events` is written by the scheduler, the rules engine, threshold checking and
the heartbeat monitor as of Phase 6. It still has no write route, which is
correct: events are recorded by the subsystem that caused them, not posted.

`automations` is DB-backed as of Phase 5, with trigger validation on write.

`controller` is fully real: `brokerOnline` and `deviceCount` since Phase 3, and
`POST /controller/command` honours pause/resume/stop since Phase 4.

DB-backed and real: `grows`, `workspaces`, `maintenance`, `devices`, `settings`,
`chart-layouts`, `thresholds`, `readings` (read and write paths).

### Placeholder pages

17–18 line "coming soon" shells: `Automation`, `GrowCycle`, `Journal`,
`Logging`, `Maintenance`, `SetupView`.

Note that **Maintenance already has a complete DB-backed backend** — only the
page is missing. It is the cheapest win on the board.

### Not started

- The **boot-level OS-managed service**, which the architecture calls a
  requirement. No systemd unit, no launchd plist, no Windows service, on any
  platform. `electron-builder.yml` is 18 lines of bare targets — no service
  registration, no signing.
- WebSocket has no per-workspace subscription filtering. `subscribe` /
  `unsubscribe` frames are parsed and then ignored, so every client receives
  every workspace's traffic. Harmless with one tent and one window; wrong as
  soon as there are two. Tagged Phase 6 in the source and deliberately left:
  the renderer never *sends* a subscribe frame, so server-side filtering today
  would be either inert or would cut the UI off from its own data. Both halves
  belong with the first multi-tent screen.
- **The Overview refresh button does not refresh the readings.** It invalidates
  the TanStack Query key `["readings", workspaceId]`, but `useLiveReadings`
  holds its own `useState` and fetches the snapshot once on mount, so that key
  matches nothing. Invisible while the websocket is up; after a dropped socket
  the numbers cannot be recovered without reopening the app.

### Security note — decide deliberately

The MQTT broker binds `0.0.0.0:1883` **unauthenticated**, while HTTP binds
`127.0.0.1`. LAN-reachable is presumably intentional (devices must connect), but
anonymous write access to the broker means anything on the network can inject
readings or commands. Decide on this explicitly rather than by default.

Phase 4 raised the stakes. Command topics are now real, so anything on the LAN
can publish to one and switch a pump or a light — no longer a data-integrity
question but a physical one. Aedes supports an `authenticate` hook; the awkward
part is credential provisioning for devices that were adopted anonymously, which
is why this is a decision and not a ticket.

## Roadmap

Ordered by dependency. Each phase unblocks the next.

### Phase 0 — Unblock ✅ done

Typecheck green, `EADDRINUSE` handled, Linux Wi-Fi scan added, git hygiene
fixed. See "Recently fixed" above.

### Phase 1 — Linux development environment ✅ done at home

Omarchy is productive: a fresh clone builds, `better-sqlite3` compiles, and
`pnpm dev` opens the Electron window under Hyprland/Wayland. See "Electron on
Linux" below for what had to be fixed.

Still open, and neither is on the critical path:

- Configure WSL2 at work (mirrored networking, systemd, native filesystem).
- Add `pacman` to the electron-builder Linux targets for Omarchy.

### Phase 2 — Device simulator ✅ done

`packages/simulator` impersonates a tent's worth of HA-discoverable MQTT
devices: 8 drifting analogue sensors, 3 actuators, plus a Shelly Gen 1 announce
so the second discovery surface is exercised too. It connects **outbound** to
the embedded broker on loopback, so it needs no LAN multicast and works under
WSL2 NAT — which is the whole reason it exists.

Run it alongside the controller with `pnpm dev:sim`. Useful knobs:
`SIM_TELEMETRY_MS` (default 5000), `SIM_SEED` (same seed, same telemetry),
`SIM_ANNOUNCE_MS`. Actuator commands are reflected back as state, so Phase 4
has something to drive on day one.

Two invariants in `fleet.ts` are easy to break by accident — device dedup keys
off the first two topic segments, and a `device_class` outside
`SENSOR_COMPONENT_MAP` silently degrades to temperature. Both are commented
there.

### Phase 3 — Telemetry ingestion ✅ done *(the keystone)*

Readings now reach `readings_raw` and the websocket, so the Overview shows live
values. Three parts:

- **Discovery records topics.** `state_topic` and `command_topic` are kept on
  the capability (`MqttTopics` in `shared-types`) instead of being reduced to a
  prefix. They are arbitrary strings chosen by the firmware and cannot be
  reconstructed later. Shelly announces carry no topics at all, so the adapter
  derives them from the documented Gen 1 layout. Capabilities are stored as
  JSON, so this needed no migration.
- **`device-manager/ingest.ts`** holds a topic index rebuilt from the devices
  table, and registers on the broker's message hook. It is deliberately **not**
  gated on a scan session: discovery only listens during a scan's 20s window,
  whereas telemetry must be ingested for the life of the service. The index
  reloads at startup and after any change to the device set, so forgetting a
  device stops its telemetry immediately.
- **Only sensor channels produce readings.** An actuator publishing `ON` counts
  as proof of life and refreshes the heartbeat, which until now was written but
  never called by anything.

Known limits, deliberately not addressed: payload parsing handles bare numbers
and a few conventional JSON keys, **not** HA `value_template` expressions; and
a sensor whose `device_class` is outside `SENSOR_COMPONENT_MAP` is recorded as
temperature/°C rather than rejected, so it now writes mislabelled rows instead
of nothing. Both want attention before real hardware.

Per-workspace WebSocket filtering was listed here and was **not** done — see
"Not started".

### Phase 4 — Actuation ✅ done

`POST /devices/:deviceId/actuate` publishes a real command. The path is
route → `device-manager/actuate.ts` → family adapter → broker.

- **Adapters encode, they do not publish.** Each family returns a topic and a
  payload; `actuate.ts` publishes it. That split is what makes the wire format
  testable without a running broker, and it matters because a wrong payload
  fails *silently* — the broker accepts it and the device ignores it.
- **The formats genuinely differ.** Home Assistant style takes `ON`/`OFF` (or
  whatever `payload_on`/`payload_off` declared) on the command topic, with
  brightness rescaled onto its own topic when one was declared. Shelly Gen 1
  takes lowercase `on`/`off`, and a dimmer's level as JSON on `.../set`.
  Tasmota and ESPHome share the HA encoder until one of them needs something it
  cannot express.
- **Ambiguity is refused, not guessed.** `ActuateBody.channel` is optional for
  a device with one actuator and required for a two-relay Shelly, where picking
  wrong would switch the wrong load.
- **202, not 200.** The command reached the broker; that is not the same as the
  device having acted. Confirmation is the device echoing state, which arrives
  through ingestion.

Discovery now also captures `payload_on` / `payload_off` /
`brightness_command_topic` / `brightness_scale`, for the same reason it captures
topics: the firmware chooses them and they cannot be reconstructed later.

**Controller lifecycle** also landed here. `POST /controller/command` honours
pause/resume/stop and pushes the new status over the websocket so every open
window agrees:

| State | Ingests | Actuates |
|---|---|---|
| `running` | yes | yes |
| `paused` | yes | no |
| `stopped` | no | no |

`paused` is the state to use while working in the tent — readings keep
accumulating and nothing turns a fan on behind you. Actuation attempts are
refused with `controller_paused` (HTTP 409).

The state is **in memory only**: a restarted controller comes back `running`.
That is the deliberate choice — a grow controller that silently stays stopped
across a reboot is the more dangerous default. Worth revisiting in Phase 8,
when the service starts at boot without anyone present.

Not done here: nothing records or reports **actuator state**. The device echoes
it on the state topic and ingestion treats it as proof of life only, because
there is no `ServerMessage` for it and no UI consuming one. Adding both belongs
with the first screen that shows a control.

### Phase 5 — Scheduler ✅ done

One interval in `scheduler/` drives two things that answer to different rules.

**Time-driven automations**, evaluated every tick against the *workspace's*
timezone, not the host's. Two trigger shapes, and the distinction is the main
design decision of this phase:

- **`window`** (new) is a *state*: "on 06:00, off 18:00" says what the tent
  should look like at any instant. Each tick derives the desired state and acts
  only when it differs from what was last applied. A controller that reboots at
  10:00 mid-photoperiod therefore re-derives the window and switches the lights
  on. A pure cron scheduler would have missed the 06:00 edge and left the tent
  dark all day, and "a missed light cycle harms plants" is the reason this
  service exists at all. Applied state is held in memory precisely so a restart
  re-applies rather than assumes.
- **`schedule`** (cron) is an *event*. It fires when an occurrence falls in the
  elapsed tick interval, and one missed during downtime stays missed —
  replaying a skipped irrigation pulse hours late is worse than skipping it.
  The first tick after a restart only establishes a baseline.

A window's `actions` describe the state *inside* it; outside, each action's
role is driven off. So the prototype's "on 06:00 · off 00:00 · 100%" card is one
automation, not two. Automations target **roles**, so the scheduler resolves
role → device + channel at fire time and hardware can be swapped underneath.

`cron-parser` is lenient in a way that matters here: an empty expression parses
as *every minute*, and a four-field one as every minute for a whole day. Field
count is validated before anything reaches it.

**Internal jobs** are rows in the `jobs` table, not timers, so a controller that
was off for a day resumes with everything due rather than restarting every
schedule from now. Implemented: `rollup_hourly`, `rollup_daily`, `prune_raw`,
`prune_hourly`, `vacuum`.

Two properties worth not breaking:

- **Rollups are idempotent.** Each deletes the buckets it is about to write.
  Re-running repairs a partial result rather than doubling it, which matters
  because the controller can be stopped mid-job. Both aggregate from
  `readings_raw`, never chaining daily off hourly: averaging an average is only
  correct when every hour has the same sample count, and a device dropping out
  for twenty minutes breaks that.
- **Pruning is guarded by the rollups.** Neither prune will delete past the
  point its downstream aggregate has actually reached, even when the retention
  window says it may. Deleting un-aggregated raw destroys it permanently. A
  stalled rollup now shows up as a growing database instead of silently missing
  history.

Lifecycle: jobs keep running while `paused` (aggregating is monitoring);
automations do not (acting is not). `stopped` halts both.

Not done here, and both deliberately: **`archive_grow`** needs the separate
archive-database design from "Retention" below, and **`maintenance_check`**
cannot do anything useful while nothing accumulates device runtime hours. Both
job types are rescheduled rather than repeatedly failed.

### Phase 6 — Rules engine ✅ done

Condition → action, evaluated on the **ingest path** so a rule reacts to a
reading as it arrives rather than on a polling interval.

The hazard a rules engine has and a scheduler does not is **flapping**: a sensor
sitting on its threshold would toggle an extractor fan every few seconds, and
relays and compressors do not survive that. Two guards:

- **Edge-triggered.** Actions fire on the transition into the condition, not on
  every reading that satisfies it. The rule re-arms only once the condition
  lapses.
- **Dwell** (`forSeconds`). The condition must hold *continuously* for that long
  before anything fires, and the counter resets the moment it lapses, so a
  single noisy sample cannot trip a rule and a flapping one cannot accumulate
  its way to a firing.

Rule state is in memory: a restart re-arms everything rather than inheriting a
stale belief about the tent. Re-firing a correct action after a restart is safe;
skipping one because of remembered state is not. Rules are cached and reloaded
whenever an automation changes, so one the user just saved arms immediately.

**Threshold alerts** are the other half. A rule *does* something; an alert
*says* something, and the two must agree — so both judge a reading with the same
`evalThreshold`, which moved into `shared-types` for exactly that reason. The
frontend now re-exports it rather than keeping a second copy. `calcGrowStage`
moved with it, because thresholds are stage-scoped and the controller needs the
same answer the UI is displaying.

Alerts are edge-triggered per channel for the same reason rules are: a row per
reading that is still too hot buries the crossing that mattered. Recovery is
recorded too, so the feed's last word on a metric is not always alarming.

**The `events` table is now populated** from four sources: automation firings
(Phase 5 and 6), threshold crossings and recoveries, and devices going offline
and coming back. The Overview's activity feed has real content.

Shared `automation/apply.ts` holds role resolution, actuation and event
recording, used by both the scheduler and the rules engine. A feed where a
scheduled firing and a rule firing were described differently would be worse
than no feed.

Not done here: **per-workspace websocket filtering**, which the source comments
tagged Phase 6. The server side is easy; the reason it was left is that the
renderer never sends a `subscribe` frame, so filtering would either be inert or
would silently cut the UI off from its own data. It belongs with the first
multi-tent screen. See "Not started".

### Phase 7 — Pages *(next)*

In dependency order:

1. **Maintenance** — backend already done, cheapest win.
2. **Automation** — needs Phases 5 and 6.
3. **Logging** — unblocked: Phase 3 supplies the readings and Phase 5 the
   rollups the longer ranges chart from.
4. **Grow Cycle** and **Journal** — their routes are stubs; do the backend
   persistence first.
5. **Setup View** — last, being the least operationally urgent, but it is
   *designed* and no longer blocked.

All eight pages have a high-fidelity prototype to build from — see "Reference
material". There is no design debt on this phase.

### Phase 8 — Service install & packaging

The real cross-platform push, with everything else working:

- **Linux** — systemd system service (develop at home, verify under WSL2
  systemd at work).
- **Windows** — Windows service, registered by the NSIS installer with one-time
  elevation.
- **macOS** — launchd LaunchDaemon.

The rule from the original architecture still holds: **the service is never
spawned or owned by the UI.** Closing the window must never stop the controller.

---

## Two-machine workflow

The repo syncs through `origin` (`github.com/LASR-0/Canopy.git`). Two hazards
were cleared in Phase 0 and are recorded here so they are not reintroduced:

**Tracked build artifacts.** `tsconfig.node.tsbuildinfo` and
`tsconfig.web.tsbuildinfo` were committed. They are regenerated on every build,
so they produced spurious diffs on every machine switch. Now gitignored and
untracked — keep them that way.

**Line endings.** `core.autocrlf=true` is set on Windows and there was no
`.gitattributes`. That stops being survivable in Phase 8, when shell scripts
and systemd units arrive on Linux with CRLF — `bad interpreter: /bin/bash^M`.
`.gitattributes` now sets `* text=auto eol=lf` and forces `*.sh` to LF.

**Do not sync the OneDrive folder to Linux.** Clone fresh from GitHub.
`node_modules` is correctly gitignored, so each machine builds its own native
modules — which is exactly what you want, since `better-sqlite3` and Electron
are platform-specific binaries.

### Omarchy (home, native)

- Arch + Hyprland means **Wayland**. Electron defaults to XWayland, which is
  blurry on HiDPI. Set `ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT=auto` for native Wayland.
- The window is already `frame: false` on non-macOS with a renderer-drawn
  titlebar, which suits a tiling WM — but verify dragging and the window
  controls behave under Hyprland.
- This is the machine with real hardware, so mDNS discovery and real device
  testing happen here.
- Chromium logs two harmless errors at startup and during rendering on this
  NVIDIA + Wayland combination: `'--ozone-platform=wayland' is not compatible
  with Vulkan`, and intermittent `Frame latency is negative`. Both are noise.
  Resist "fixing" them with GPU switches — disabling Vulkan did not silence the
  Vulkan warning, so the mechanism is not what it appears to be, and the flags
  would change rendering for every Linux user to quiet a log line.
- **Do not run `pnpm dev` from a VS Code integrated terminal that inherits
  `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`.** Electron then runs as plain Node and no window
  ever opens, with no error to explain it.

### Electron on Linux — two faults, one symptom

Both surfaced as the same message, `Error: Electron uninstall`, and neither is
obvious from it. Recorded because they will recur on any fresh clone or Node
upgrade.

1. **Electron 42 dropped its install-time download.** It has no `postinstall`
   at all and fetches the runtime lazily on the first `require("electron")`.
   electron-vite never takes that path — it reads `node_modules/electron/path.txt`
   directly — so nothing ever triggered the download. Fixed with an explicit
   `postinstall: install-electron` in `packages/frontend`. `install-electron` is
   Electron's own downloader and is a no-op once the runtime is present.
2. **The unzip silently fails on modern Node.** Electron unzips via
   `extract-zip`, which pins the abandoned yauzl 2 / fd-slicer 1.1.0 pair.
   fd-slicer assigns `this.destroyed` directly; on current Node that is a setter
   marking the readable destroyed, so its final `push(null)` is dropped, no
   `end` is emitted, and extraction stalls after one file of 74 — **exiting 0**.
   Fixed with a pnpm override pinning yauzl 3 inside `extract-zip`; yauzl 3
   dropped fd-slicer and is API-compatible.

Note that pnpm does not always re-read `pnpm-workspace.yaml` settings when
nothing else changed — it can report "Already up to date" and skip the new
override entirely. If a settings change appears to do nothing, force a
re-resolve.

### WSL2 (work)

- **Work inside the WSL filesystem (`~/`), never `/mnt/c`.** Native module
  builds and pnpm are dramatically slower there, and file watching is
  unreliable.
- **Default NAT networking blocks LAN discovery.** mDNS multicast will not reach
  WSL2, and LAN devices cannot reach the broker. Create `%UserProfile%\.wslconfig`
  with `networkingMode=mirrored` (Windows 11 22H2+; this machine qualifies).
  Even mirrored, treat multicast as unreliable — this is why Phase 2 exists.
- **Enable systemd** in `/etc/wsl.conf` (`[boot]\nsystemd=true`) so the Phase 8
  service unit can be developed and tested at work too.
- WSLg handles the Electron GUI; `--no-sandbox` may be needed.
- **Corporate TLS interception.** The work network MITMs TLS — the certificate
  served for `registry.npmjs.org` is issued by `CN=firewall.intern.ksb.com`, not
  by a public root. Windows git survives this because it uses the `schannel`
  backend and the Windows cert store, where IT installed `CN=KSB-Root-CA`.
  Inside WSL, git, pnpm, node and curl each use their own CA bundle and will
  fail with SSL errors until that root is trusted there too.

  Check before assuming either way:

  ```bash
  curl -sI https://registry.npmjs.org >/dev/null && echo OK || echo "TLS blocked"
  ```

  If it fails, install the root and point Node at it:

  ```bash
  sudo cp ksb-root-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
  sudo update-ca-certificates
  echo 'export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt' >> ~/.bashrc
  ```

  Never commit the certificate to this repo — it is site-specific, and a public
  repo is the wrong home for it.

---

## Architecture (unchanged)

The backend is a **long-running, OS-managed service**, independent of the UI.
This is a grow controller — a missed light or irrigation cycle harms plants — so
"runs when the UI is closed and survives a reboot" is a requirement.

- **Boot-level service**, registered by the installer with one-time elevation.
  Never spawned or owned by the UI; that single rule eliminates the
  child-process trap where closing the window kills the backend.
- The **UI is an unprivileged client**. It finds the backend via `GET /health`
  and connects over HTTP + WebSocket.
- Controller states are explicit: `running` / `paused` / `stopped`. "Stopped" is
  deliberate and distinct from "window closed".

**Two deployment shapes, one codebase:** single host (expected common case), and
headless (backend on an always-on box such as a Pi by the tent, UI across the
LAN). The HTTP/WS boundary exists from the start, so headless needs no retrofit.
The backend is pure JS — aedes, bonjour-service and better-sqlite3 all build on
ARM Linux — so a Pi target is a packaging concern, not a porting one.

---

## Stack & decisions

**Monorepo** — pnpm 11 workspaces. `pnpm install` at the root populates one
`node_modules` with per-package symlinks. Never `npm install` — the repo uses
the `workspace:` protocol, which npm cannot resolve.

- `@canopy/shared-types` — domain entities, the `ApiRoutes` HTTP contract, and
  the WebSocket `ServerMessage`/`ClientMessage` protocol. Both sides import it,
  so backend handlers and the frontend client cannot drift. This is the source
  of truth for every domain decision.
- `@canopy/backend` — the controller service.
- `@canopy/frontend` — Electron + React UI.

**Language** — TypeScript, ESM throughout. `tsconfig.base.json` is strict:
`verbatimModuleSyntax`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`,
`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. (That last one is what the `provision.ts` break is.)

**Frontend** — Electron 42 + electron-vite 5 + electron-builder 26. React 19,
Vite 8. Tailwind v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite` (CSS-first, no JS config).
shadcn/ui on Radix, copied into the repo. TanStack Table for lists, Recharts for
the Logging charts, hand-rolled `Sparkline` inline. TanStack Query for server
state; **Zustand deferred** until the live WebSocket stream needs
selector-based subscriptions. The Electron main process is deliberately thin —
native window only.

**Backend** — Node service. SQLite via **Drizzle** (*Prisma rejected: its native
query-engine binary is painful in Electron*). Embedded **Aedes** MQTT broker
(pure JS). **`bonjour-service`** for mDNS (*avoid the native `mdns` package — it
needs a compiler and the Bonjour SDK, and breaks cross-platform packaging*).
**Fastify** for HTTP + WebSocket.

**Theme** — GitHub Primer tokens. Light and dark are structurally identical,
only token values differ, so theming is a pure CSS-variable swap on a
`data-theme` attribute.

---

## Device support (v1 scope)

Deliberately narrow: **local HTTP + MQTT only, no Home Assistant dependency.**
Canopy discovers and controls devices itself.

**Two discovery models:**

- **HTTP/Wi-Fi devices** advertise over **mDNS** and are actively found. A
  brute-force subnet probe is deferred to a later opt-in "advanced scan".
- **MQTT devices** are broker-mediated — they publish to the embedded broker and
  are found by watching topics. Canopy listens for the Home-Assistant-style
  retained discovery convention (`homeassistant/<type>/<id>/config`) to
  auto-populate devices *with their capabilities* — the convention only, not HA.

**Adapters** — one small adapter per family: Shelly, Tasmota, ESPHome,
generic-MQTT (fallback). Two transports does not mean two integrations.

**Device model** — `family` + `protocol` + detected `capabilities`
(sensor/actuator channels). **Roles** bind a capability to a functional purpose
("exhaust fan", "canopy temp"), so automations target a role, not a device id,
and hardware can be swapped without breaking rules.

**OS realities:** macOS Local Network permission for discovery; firewall
allowance for the broker port on every platform; WSL2 NAT as covered above.

## Features

Everything is scoped to a workspace (tent). The switcher scopes all data.

**Navigation:** Monitor (Overview, Setup View) · Manage (Automation, Grow Cycle,
Journal) · Service (Maintenance, Logging) · Config (Settings).

- **Overview** — sensor cards, sparklines, activity feed; empty and configured
  states derived from data.
- **Setup View** — visual tent layout (device, sensor, pot placement) to compare
  layouts across grows.
- **Automation** — capability-driven, organised by subsystem. Two kinds:
  **schedule** (time → scheduler) and **rule** (condition → rules engine).
  Scopable to a grow stage or mode.
- **Grow Cycle** — stages (seedling/veg/flower/flush/harvest); status machine
  `planned → active → completed | aborted`; harvest screen captures rating,
  yield and notes.
- **Journal** — live notebook for the current grow plus a history archive of
  completed grows, with cross-grow comparison.
- **Maintenance** — recurring reminders: sensor cleaning, filter swaps, nutrient
  top-ups, calibration; due-date tracking.
- **Logging** — sensor data over time, chart-heavy, per-workspace plus history.
- **Settings** — device connection, scanning, provisioning, role assignment.

**UX convention:** forms, confirmations and editing are **inline** (Primer /
GitHub style), not external modal dialogs, wherever possible.

**Retention** — tiered: keep `raw` about a week, roll up to `hourly` / `daily`
long-term. The live operational SQLite DB stays hot; a separate archive DB file
is opened on demand for completed grows, keeping the live DB and its backups
small. Rollups, archiving and `VACUUM INTO` backups run as internal scheduled
jobs (reusing the scheduler, not a separate cron).

## Reference material

- **High-fidelity prototypes** in `prototype/` — working React apps, not static
  mockups, already branded Canopy. Canonical reference for screens and
  components.
  - `SetupView_Configured_{light,dark}.html` (~268 KB) are the current full
    prototype and cover **all eight pages**. `Overview_Empty_light.html` is an
    older, narrower snapshot.
  - **Every page is designed** — including Maintenance (with Today / Week /
    History sub-views), Logging and Setup View, all three of which `HANDOFF.md`
    wrongly listed as pending. Most pages also have a designed empty state
    (`OverviewEmpty`, `AutomationEmpty`, `LoggingEmpty`, `MaintenanceEmpty`,
    `SettingsEmpty`, `SetupViewEmpty`).
  - There is no design debt left. Every remaining page can be built straight
    from these files.
- **`@canopy/shared-types`** — every domain decision, encoded as types.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install          # root; populates node_modules for all packages
pnpm dev              # backend + UI together (parallel)
pnpm dev:backend      # controller only
pnpm dev:ui           # Electron UI only
pnpm dev:sim          # simulated devices; run alongside pnpm dev
pnpm typecheck        # all packages
pnpm test             # backend vitest suite
pnpm build:ui         # electron-vite build
```

Default ports: HTTP/WS `7001` (localhost), MQTT `1883` (all interfaces).

Only one controller may run at a time — it owns the database and the broker. A
second one exits with a clear message rather than an `EADDRINUSE` stack trace,
so if the UI says the controller is offline, check for a stray instance holding
`7001`/`1883` before debugging anything else.
